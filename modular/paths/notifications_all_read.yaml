        Boolean to specify whether to mark as read or unread (defaults to
        `true`, marking as read)
      required: false
      schema:

        A comma-seperated list of IDs. Allows specifying an array of
        notification IDs to change the read state for. This will become useful
        as we add grouping of notifications to the UI, with a single button to
        mark all notifications in the group as read/unread.
