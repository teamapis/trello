        By default, Trello searches for each word in your query against exactly
        matching words within Member content. Specifying partial to be true
        means that we will look for content that starts with any of the words in
        your query.  If you are looking for a Card titled "My Development Status
        Report", by default you would need to search for "Development". If you
        have partial enabled, you will be able to search for "dev" but not
        "velopment".
